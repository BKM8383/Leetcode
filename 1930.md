# [1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-length-3-palindromic-subsequences/description/)

</div>

Given a string s, return the number of unique palindromes of length three that are a subsequence of s.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted once.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
Example 2:

Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
Example 3:

Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only lowercase English letters.



## Brute Force( O(n^3) )

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequence(string s) {

        int count=0;
        set<string> a;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size()-2;i++){
            for(int j=i+2;j<s.size();j++){
                if(s[i]==s[j]){
                    for(int k=i+1;k<j;k++){
                        string x={s[i],s[k],s[j]};
                        a.insert(x);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return a.size();
    }
};
```

## Brute force but better (O(n^2))

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequence(string s) {

        int count=0;
        set<string> a;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size()-2;i++){
            int last=i;
            for(int j=i+2;j<s.size();j++){
                if(s[i]==s[j]){
                    last=j;
                }
            }
            for(int k=i+1;k<last;k++){
                        string x={s[i],s[k],s[last]};
                        a.insert(x);
                    }
        }

        return a.size();
    }
};
```


## first & last occurence of a character with set (O(n))

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequence(string s) {
        vector<int> f(26, -1); // First occurrence of each character
        vector<int> l(26, -1); // Last occurrence of each character

        // Find the first and last occurrence of each character
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (f[s[i] - 'a'] == -1) 
                f[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
            l[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }

        int count = 0;

        // Loop over each character and calculate unique palindromic subsequences
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (f[i] != l[i]) { // Character appears more than once
                unordered_set<char> uniqueChars;
                // Check all characters between first and last occurrence
                for (int j = f[i] + 1; j < l[i]; j++) {
                    uniqueChars.insert(s[j]);
                }
                // Add the count of unique characters between the first and last occurrence
                count += uniqueChars.size();
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```


## fastest bitset (O(n))

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countPalindromicSubsequence(string s) {
        bitset<26> e;  // Bitset to track which characters appear between first and last occurrence
        int ans = 0;  // Variable to store the count of unique palindromic subsequences

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {  // Loop over each character ('a' to 'z')
            int f = s.find('a' + i);  // Find the first occurrence of the character 'a' + i
            if (f != string::npos) {  // If the character exists in the string
                int l = s.find_last_of('a' + i);  // Find the last occurrence of the character 'a' + i

                if (l - f < 2)  // If the distance between first and last occurrence is less than 2, skip it
                    continue;

                // Iterate through characters between first and last occurrence (excluding them)
                for (int j = f + 1; j < l; j++) {
                    e.set(s[j] - 'a');  // Set the bit corresponding to the character s[j]
                    if (e.count() == 26)  // If all possible characters have been found (unlikely, early break optimization)
                        break;
                }
            }

            // Add the number of unique characters found in the range [f+1, l-1] to the answer
            ans += e.count();  // Use e.count() to get the number of unique characters, not e.size()
            
            e.reset();  // Reset the bitset for the next iteration
        }

        return ans;  // Return the final count of palindromic subsequences
    }
};
